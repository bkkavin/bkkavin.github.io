      <description>Twitter is bad. Consider your age.
That is the amount of years of experience you have on this planet.
You are unique. That is the truth.

To share your experience, which is something that can ever be fully translated to text, they have given a limit of 140 characters.
I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of guy who would read your journal (only if you want me to).</description>
